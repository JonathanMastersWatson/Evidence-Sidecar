# Authority Limits

The evidence sidecar defined in this repository operates under strict and explicit authority limits.

These limits are intentional.  
They exist to prevent the accumulation of hidden power.

---

## No Inherited Authority

The sidecar must not inherit authority from:

- the system it observes,
- the organization that operates it,
- or the parties that fund it.

Its authority is limited exclusively to the production and preservation of evidence.

---

## No Delegated Authority

The sidecar must not be delegated authority to:

- approve actions,
- validate correctness,
- enforce compliance,
- restrict access,
- or adjudicate disputes.

Delegation of authority transforms a witness into a governor.

This repository forbids such designs.

---

## No Implicit Authority

Authority must not emerge implicitly through:

- technical dependencies,
- operational coupling,
- or economic pressure embedded in the architecture.

Examples of prohibited implicit authority include:

- execution paths that rely on evidence availability,
- systems that cannot operate without witness confirmation,
- or settlement mechanisms that block execution.

Authority must be explicit, minimal, and bounded.

---

## Independence from Incentives

The sidecar must not have incentives that conflict with neutrality.

It must not:

- profit from specific outcomes,
- benefit from selective omission,
- or optimize for interpretations of evidence.

Economic activity related to evidence settlement must be strictly separated from evidence generation.

---

## No Enforcement Capabilities

The sidecar must not:

- trigger enforcement actions,
- initiate penalties,
- or cause downstream systems to act.

Any enforcement based on evidence occurs externally and voluntarily.

---

## Temporal Authority Constraints

The sidecar’s authority is retrospective only.

It may:

- record events after they occur,
- disclose evidence upon request,
- and attest to historical integrity.

It may not:

- influence real-time decisions,
- predict outcomes,
- or preempt actions.

---

## Legal Posture

In legal and regulatory contexts, the sidecar’s limited authority ensures that:

- it cannot be accused of causation,
- it does not bear responsibility for outcomes,
- and it serves as an independent recorder.

This boundary materially reduces liability.

---

## Prohibited Extensions

The following extensions violate authority limits and are disallowed:

- real-time compliance scoring
- automated approvals or rejections
- policy enforcement engines
- outcome ranking or classification

Such capabilities must exist outside this architecture.

---

## Summary

Authority is the scarcest resource in complex systems.

This repository defines an evidence sidecar that is intentionally weak, limited, and constrained.

Its strength derives from what it cannot do.
