# Voluntary Systems Principle

The evidence sidecar defined in this repository is designed to operate only within **voluntary systems**.

Participation in evidence production, disclosure, or settlement must not be compulsory at the architectural level.

Adoption is a choice.  
Consequences are emergent.

## Definition of a Voluntary System

A voluntary system is one in which:

- participation is not enforced by the system itself,
- actors may enter or exit without coercion,
- and compliance is not a prerequisite for execution.

The sidecar must not introduce coercive mechanics into such systems.

---

## No Forced Participation

The evidence sidecar must not:

- require enrollment to operate the underlying system,
- block participation for non-compliant actors,
- impose mandatory settlement or disclosure,
- or enforce conformity through technical means.

Systems may choose to integrate a witness.  
They must not be forced to.

---

## Evidence as an Opt-In Property

Evidence production under this architecture is:

- explicitly opt-in,
- externally observable,
- and retrospectively valuable.

Systems that opt in gain:

- stronger evidentiary standing,
- reduced liability ambiguity,
- and improved insurability.

Systems that opt out retain autonomy, but accept increased exposure.

This asymmetry is intentional.

---

## No Soft Coercion

Voluntariness excludes indirect coercion, including:

- degraded performance for non-participants,
- artificial friction introduced by the sidecar,
- or economic penalties enforced by the architecture itself.

Any such mechanism constitutes hidden authority and is prohibited.

---

## Exit Is Always Preserved

A voluntary system must always permit:

- disengagement from the witness,
- cessation of evidence generation,
- or migration to an alternative witness implementation.

Exit may result in evidence gaps.  
Exit must not result in system failure.

---

## Market and Regulatory Dynamics

While participation is voluntary at the technical level, external forces may influence adoption.

These may include:

- regulatory expectations,
- contractual requirements,
- insurance underwriting criteria,
- or counterparty demands.

Such forces exist outside the architecture.

This repository does not encode or enforce them.

---

## Interoperability and Competition

Voluntariness requires that:

- multiple independent implementations may exist,
- no single provider controls the witness function,
- and systems may switch providers without lock-in.

Reference architectures that prevent competition violate this principle.

---

## Summary

The evidence sidecar enables proof, not obedience.

Systems choose whether to produce evidence.  
Markets, regulators, and courts determine how that choice is valued.

Voluntariness is preserved by design.
