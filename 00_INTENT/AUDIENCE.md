# Audience

This repository is written for professionals who design, operate, regulate, insure, or underwrite complex digital systems where post-event disputes, liability, or loss of trust are material risks.

It is not written for end users, consumers, activists, or marketing audiences.

## Primary Audiences

### Systems Engineers and Architects

This repository addresses engineers who are responsible for:

- high-availability systems,
- safety-critical infrastructure,
- regulated production environments,
- or systems where downtime is unacceptable.

For this audience, the repository provides:

- clear architectural constraints,
- failure mode analysis,
- non-negotiable principles (e.g., fail-open),
- and implementable patterns that do not interfere with execution.

Engineering readers should be able to design compliant systems without ambiguity or philosophical interpretation.

### Legal, Risk, and Compliance Professionals

This repository is written to be legible to:

- General Counsel
- Chief Risk Officers
- Compliance and audit teams
- External legal reviewers

For this audience, the repository provides:

- defensible distinctions between execution and evidence,
- clarity on independence and non-interference,
- a framework for selective disclosure,
- and language suitable for regulatory and litigation contexts.

The goal is not to replace legal judgment, but to provide technical structures that withstand scrutiny.

### CFOs, Insurers, and Underwriters

This repository is intended to be intelligible to:

- Chief Financial Officers
- Risk committees
- Insurance underwriters
- Actuarial and audit teams

For this audience, the repository explains:

- why independent evidence reduces tail risk,
- how costs are bounded and predictable,
- why fail-open design limits operational exposure,
- and how evidence infrastructure aligns with insurability.

Financial readers should understand why this architecture exists and how it functions as a qualifying control, even without technical depth.

---

### Regulators and Policy Technologists

This repository is designed to be usable by:

- technical regulators,
- standards bodies,
- and policy teams defining reasonable controls.

It avoids:

- ideological framing,
- vendor-specific dependencies,
- and normative claims.

Regulatory readers should be able to reference its principles without endorsing a specific implementation or commercial entity.

---

## Secondary Audiences

### Platform and Infrastructure Vendors

Vendors may use this repository as a reference when:

- embedding independent evidence capabilities,
- designing compliance-ready products,
- or integrating third-party witness systems.

This repository does not prescribe business models or licensing terms.

---

### Researchers and Standards Contributors

This repository may be referenced by:

- academic researchers,
- standards organizations,
- or independent reviewers.

However, it is not structured as a research paper or academic proposal.

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope Audiences

This repository is **not** written for:

- general consumers
- social or political advocacy groups
- marketing or sales enablement
- speculative or ideological audiences
- protocol evangelism

Any attempt to reinterpret this work for such audiences risks misrepresentation.

---

## Tone and Expectations

All documents in this repository assume:

- professional literacy,
- good-faith technical reading,
- and a focus on constraints over opinions.

Claims are framed in terms of engineering, legal, and economic necessity.

Readers seeking prescriptive ideology, moral arguments, or promotional messaging will not find them here.
