# Intent

This folder defines the **purpose, scope, and audience** of the Evidence Sidecar Reference Architecture.

It establishes *why* this architecture exists and *what it explicitly does not attempt to do*.

---

## Role in the Architecture

The documents in this folder:

- define architectural intent,
- bound expectations,
- and prevent scope creep.

They are explanatory, not normative.

---

## Contents

- `PURPOSE.md`  
  Why independent, fail-open evidence systems are required.

- `NON_GOALS.md`  
  What this architecture explicitly does not provide.

- `AUDIENCE.md`  
  Who this repository is written for and how it should be read.

---

## Reading Order

This folder should be read first.

It sets framing and prevents misinterpretation of later sections.
