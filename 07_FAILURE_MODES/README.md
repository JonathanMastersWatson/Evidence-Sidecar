# Failure Modes

This folder defines how the architecture behaves under failure,
partition, and adversarial conditions.

Failure is expected.

---

## Role in the Architecture

Failure behavior is where architectural honesty is proven.

These documents ensure that:

- failures are observable,
- gaps are explicit,
- and recovery does not fabricate continuity.

## Normative Status
