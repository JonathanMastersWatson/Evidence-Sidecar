# Interoperability

## Interoperability Goals
- Independent verification across vendors
- No shared control plane
- No shared identity authority

## Evidence Object Compatibility
- Canonical serialization rules
- Hash reproducibility requirements

## Verification Across Implementations
- What a verifier must be able to do
- What it must not assume

## Disclosure Interop
- How scoped disclosures remain verifiable
- What metadata must accompany disclosures

## What Interoperability Does NOT Require
- Shared APIs
- Shared SDKs
- Shared infrastructure
