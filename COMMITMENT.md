# Evidence Sidecar Reference Architecture — Commitment

This document serves as a public existence and intent record for the
**Evidence Sidecar Reference Architecture**.

It attests that the accompanying repository, describing a fail-open,
witness-only evidence sidecar architecture, existed in substantially
this form at or before the time this document was hashed and anchored.

---

## Scope of Commitment

This commitment applies to:

- the architectural concepts described in the repository
- the constraints, principles, and boundaries defined therein
- the non-authoritative, reference-only nature of the work

It does not assert ownership, exclusivity, or enforcement authority.

---

## What This Is Not

This commitment does not:

- certify correctness
- guarantee legal admissibility
- endorse any implementation
- claim regulatory approval
- assert control over derivative work

It records existence only.

---

## Repository Reference

Canonical repository location:

https://github.com/Jonnyrockin/Evidence-Sidecar.git

(Repository contents may evolve; this commitment anchors intent and existence,
not future revisions.)

---

## Relationship to Settlement

The hash of this document may be anchored to a public settlement ledger
to establish an immutable timestamp.

The settlement receipt serves solely as proof of existence at time of anchoring.

---

## Final Statement

This work is offered as a neutral, technical reference architecture.

Its authority derives from constraints, not control.
