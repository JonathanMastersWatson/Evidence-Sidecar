# Public Sector

This document maps the evidence sidecar architecture to public sector systems, civic infrastructure, and government-operated digital services.

Public sector systems require independent evidence because legitimacy depends on trust that cannot be self-asserted.

---

## Scope

This mapping applies to:

- electoral infrastructure,
- public records systems,
- licensing and permitting platforms,
- benefits administration,
- public communications and alerts,
- and digital civic services.

It does not prescribe policy or governance outcomes.

---

## The Public Trust Problem

Public sector systems operate under conditions where:

- decisions affect large populations,
- disputes are politically charged,
- and internal records are inherently suspect to critics.

Trust cannot be declared.  
It must be demonstrated.

---

## Sidecar Placement

In public sector contexts, the sidecar operates:

- independently of decision systems,
- observing actions and publications,
- without authority over outcomes.

The sidecar must never influence policy decisions or service delivery.

---

## Evidence Objects in Public Sector Context

Public sector Evidence Objects may represent:

- publication of official records,
- issuance of notices or alerts,
- execution of administrative actions,
- system state changes,
- or public-facing communications.

Sensitive content is not stored.

---

## Time, Continuity, and Transparency

Public systems often face scrutiny over:

- timing of decisions,
- sequence of actions,
- and continuity of records.

The sidecar preserves:

- observable ordering,
- detectable gaps,
- and disclosed interruptions.

Narrative reconstruction is avoided.

---

## Selective Disclosure in Public Contexts

Disclosure requests may arise from:

- courts,
- auditors,
- oversight bodies,
- or public inquiries.

The Disclosure Kernel enables:

- bounded evidence release,
- proof of publication or action,
- verification of integrity,
- without exposing protected information.

---

## Independence and Legitimacy

Independent evidence supports legitimacy by:

- reducing reliance on internal attestations,
- enabling third-party verification,
- and separating observation from authority.

This separation is critical in contested environments.

---

## Regulatory and Legal Alignment

Public sector systems operate under:

- administrative law,
- records retention requirements,
- and procedural fairness standards.

Fail-open evidence sidecars support these requirements without interfering with governance.

---

## Non-Goals

This architecture does not:

- define public policy,
- replace oversight mechanisms,
- or determine accountability.

It provides technical evidence only.

---

## Summary

Public trust cannot be asserted by the state.

Independent witnesses make trust observable.
