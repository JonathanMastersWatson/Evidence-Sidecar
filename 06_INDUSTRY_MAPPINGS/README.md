# Industry Mappings

This folder maps the core architecture to real-world domains.

Mappings are illustrative, not exhaustive.

## Role in the Architecture

Industry mappings:

- demonstrate applicability,
- surface domain-specific pressures,
- and validate architectural neutrality.

They do not introduce new requirements.

This folder is non-normative.

It explains *how* the architecture applies, not *what it requires*.
