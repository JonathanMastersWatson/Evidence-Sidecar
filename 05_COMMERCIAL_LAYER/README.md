# Commercial Layer

This folder defines how settlement is funded **without contaminating evidence integrity**.

Money pays for witnessing — it does not buy influence.

---

## Role in the Architecture

The commercial layer:

- funds settlement operations,
- attributes costs,
- and supports auditability.

It is explicitly separated from evidence generation and disclosure.

## Normative Status

This folder is normative with respect to **separation of concerns**.

Financial models must not alter evidence behavior.
