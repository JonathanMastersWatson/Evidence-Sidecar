# Who Pays

This document defines the economic responsibility for funding evidence settlement under this architecture.

Payment responsibility follows risk.

---

## Principle

The party that benefits from reduced ambiguity, reduced liability, or improved defensibility is responsible for funding evidence settlement.

This principle aligns cost with incentive.

---

## Primary Payer: The Evidence Producer

In most cases, the primary payer is:

- the system operator,
- the content publisher,
- the exchange,
- or the organization whose outputs may be disputed.

These parties benefit directly from:

- improved evidentiary standing,
- reduced litigation exposure,
- and increased insurability.

---

## Secondary Payers

In some contexts, settlement costs may be borne by:

- upstream content providers,
- downstream distributors,
- contractual counterparties,
- or ecosystem participants.

Such arrangements are contractual and external to this architecture.

---

## No Pay-to-Verify

Verification must not require payment by third parties.

Any party must be able to:

- independently verify evidence,
- inspect receipts,
- and validate integrity.

Charging for verification undermines trust.

---

## Cost as Operating Expense

Evidence settlement costs should be treated as:

- operational expenses,
- compliance costs,
- or risk mitigation expenditures.

They are not speculative investments.

---

## Risk-Based Pricing

Settlement costs may be allocated based on:

- volume of evidence,
- settlement frequency,
- or operational complexity.

Costs must remain bounded and predictable.

---

## Insurance Alignment

In insured environments:

- settlement costs may qualify as risk controls,
- be recognized in underwriting,
- or reduce deductibles.

Insurers do not pay directly but influence incentives.

---

## Voluntary Participation

No party is compelled to fund evidence settlement.

However, parties choosing not to do so accept:

- weaker evidentiary posture,
- increased ambiguity,
- and higher downstream risk.

---

## Summary

Those who face dispute pay for clarity.

Evidence is funded where it creates value.
