# Evidence Model

This folder defines the **structure and properties of evidence** generated by a sidecar.

It specifies how evidence is represented, chained, ordered, and verified.

---

## Role in the Architecture

The evidence model ensures that:

- evidence is tamper-evident,
- gaps are detectable,
- ordering is preserved,
- and verification is possible without trust.

It does not store payloads or content.

## Contents

- `EVIDENCE_OBJECT.md`
- `HASH_CHAINING.md`

## Normative Status

This folder is normative.

Implementations must follow these constraints to be verifiable.
