# Settlement Layer

This folder defines the **settlement layer** of the Evidence Sidecar Reference Architecture.

The settlement layer provides a **public, independent receipt mechanism** for anchoring cryptographic commitments generated by evidence sidecars.

It is a notary, not a control plane.

---

## Purpose of the Settlement Layer

The settlement layer exists to:

- establish proof of existence at a point in time,
- anchor evidence beyond the control of the observing system,
- enable independent third-party verification,
- and make tampering or retroactive alteration detectable.

It does not execute logic, store content, or influence system behavior.

---

## What the Settlement Layer Does Not Do

The settlement layer does **not**:

- execute application logic,
- validate correctness of evidence,
- interpret events or outcomes,
- enforce compliance,
- store payload or sensitive data,
- or participate in disclosure decisions.

Settlement is downstream of observation.

---

## Architectural Role

Within the overall architecture:

- Evidence is generated locally by the sidecar
- Evidence is chained cryptographically
- Evidence may be batched
- Only compact commitments are settled publicly

Settlement is **asynchronous** and **fail-open**.

Execution never depends on settlement availability.

---

## Ledger Requirements

Any ledger used for settlement **must** satisfy the requirements defined in:

- `LEDGER_REQUIREMENTS.md`

These requirements are non-negotiable and property-based.

The architecture constrains *behavior*, not platforms.

---

## Ledger Profiles

This folder includes descriptive profiles for ledgers that satisfy the required properties:

- `XRPL_PROFILE.md`  
  Describes the XRP Ledger as a currently qualifying settlement layer.

- `ALT_LEDGER_PROFILE.md`  
  Describes a generic alternative ledger profile to demonstrate interchangeability
  and avoid ecosystem lock-in.

Profiles are descriptive, not endorsing.

---

## Cost and Batching

Settlement cost management and batching strategies are defined in:

- `COST_AND_BATCHING.md`

Batching ensures that settlement cost remains:

- predictable,
- bounded,
- and decoupled from event frequency.

---

## Finality and Receipts

The semantics of settlement finality and receipt verification are defined in:

- `FINALITY_AND_RECEIPTS.md`

Finality proves **existence**, not correctness.

---

## Failure Considerations

Ledger unavailability, delay, or partition does not invalidate evidence.

Failure behavior is defined in:

- `07_FAILURE_MODES/LEDGER_UNAVAILABLE.md`

Deferred settlement must be observable and honest.

---

## Non-Exclusivity

The settlement layer is intentionally replaceable.

Any ledger satisfying the defined requirements may be used without changing:

- evidence object structure,
- disclosure semantics,
- or authority boundaries.

---

## Summary

The settlement layer witnesses that evidence existed.

It does not decide what evidence means.

If settlement is unavailable, reality continues — and evidence waits.
