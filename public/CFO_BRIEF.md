# CFO Brief

This document explains the evidence sidecar architecture in financial and risk terms.

It is written for CFOs, risk committees, and financial controllers.

## The Financial Problem

In digital operations, the largest losses rarely come from incidents themselves.

They come from:
- inability to reconstruct events,
- prolonged disputes,
- litigation and settlement costs,
- regulatory penalties,
- and insurance friction.

Internal logs are often insufficient when stakes are high.

---

## What This Architecture Does

The evidence sidecar provides:

- independent, cryptographically verifiable records,
- external anchoring beyond internal control,
- and observable proof of continuity or failure.

It does **not** interfere with operations.

---

## Cost Characteristics

Settlement costs are:

- low,
- predictable,
- and batchable.

Costs do not scale linearly with throughput.

They behave like infrastructure overhead, not variable transaction fees.

---

## Accounting Treatment

Settlement costs are treated as:

- operating expenses,
- compliance costs,
- or risk mitigation expenditures.

They are auditable, attributable, and reconcilable.

No novel accounting treatment is required.

---

## Risk Reduction

Independent evidence reduces:

- ambiguity in disputes,
- duration of investigations,
- reliance on testimony,
- and exposure to fraud allegations.

This compresses tail risk.

---

## Insurance Alignment

Insurers price uncertainty.

Systems with independent witnesses benefit from:
- clearer incident reconstruction,
- lower forensic costs,
- improved underwriting posture.

Evidence infrastructure functions as a qualifying control.

---

## What This Is Not

This architecture is not:
- a revenue generator,
- a speculative asset,
- or a compliance gate.

It is operational risk infrastructure.

---

## Executive Takeaway

This is not about preventing failure.

It is about **proving what happened when failure occurs**.

That proof is increasingly where financial outcomes are decided.
